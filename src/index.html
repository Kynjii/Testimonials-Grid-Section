          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny’s worth.

          “I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been
          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup.”

        Jonathan Walters Verified Graduate The team was very supportive and kept
        me motivated “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding
        skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one
        of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”

        Patrick Abrams Verified Graduate Awesome teaching support from TAs who
        did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning
        from their experiences was easy. “ The staff seem genuinely concerned
        about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me
        the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
        myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
        You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
        community of 1440art and amazing people. ”

        Kira Whittle Verified Graduate Such a life-changing experience. Highly
        recommended! “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
        code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
        of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
        entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
        and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
        particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
        way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
        during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
        certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
        multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
